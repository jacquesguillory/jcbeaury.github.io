description: "I'm currently re-designing and constructing mobile (iOS & Android) apps for Avail Technologies. They provide 'Intelligent Transportation Systems' that connect riders, transportation companies, and their data. The apps use data feeds to build simple realtime transit maps and share the data with Google Maps."
